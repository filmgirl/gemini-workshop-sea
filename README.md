# AI Camp Seattle Gemini Deep Dive, March 31, 2025

## Workshop Guide:


* [AI Studio](https://ai.dev) - Google AI Studio
* [Create an API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) - Create a free API Key
* [Search Grounding](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Search_Grounding.ipynb) -  Grounding using Search as a tool
* [Multimodal Live API Quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_LiveAPI.ipynb) - This notebook demonstrates simple usage of the Gemini 2.0 Multimodal Live API. For an overview of new capabilities refer to the [Gemini 2.0 docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-v2).
* [Spatial Understanding](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Spatial_understanding.ipynb) - This notebook introduces object detection and spatial understanding with the Gemini API like in the Spatial understanding example from AI Studio and demonstrated in the Building with Gemini 2.0: Spatial understanding video.
* [Gemini 2.0 - Multimodal Live API](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_LiveAPI_tools.ipynb) - This notebook provides examples of how to use tools with the multimodal live API with Gemini 2.0.
* [Gemini Thinking](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_thinking.ipynb) - Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental and Gemini Flash 2.0 Thinking are models that are trained to generate the "thinking process" the model goes through as part of its response. As a result, those models are capable of stronger reasoning capabilities in its responses than previous models.
* [Gemini Deep Research](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/?hl=en) - Explore Deep Research in Gemini 
* [Code Execution](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Code_Execution.ipynb) - The Gemini API code execution feature enables the model to generate and run Python code based on plain-text instructions that you give it, and even output graphs.
* [Imagen](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started_imagen.ipynb)  - The imagen-3.0-generate-002 model is Google's highest quality text-to-image model, featuring a number of new and improved capabilities. 
* [Embeddings](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb) - The Gemini API generates state-of-the-art text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that represent the meaning of a word, sentence, or paragraph. You can use embeddings in many downstream applications like document search.
* Gemini 2.5 Pro - Available in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25) and the [Gemini app](https://gemini.google.com/app).
